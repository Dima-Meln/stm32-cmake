 @par Directory contents
 
 - Project.uvproj/.uvopt: A pre-configured project file with the provided library 
                          structure that produces an executable image with MDK-ARM.

@note Enabling "Options for Target — Output – Browser Information" is useful for
      quick source files navigation but may slow the compilation time.                 
 
 
 @par How to use it ?
 
 - Open the Project.uvproj project
 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
 - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
 - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)

 @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
       preprocessor section: USE_STM324xG_EVAL, STM32F4XX, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER
