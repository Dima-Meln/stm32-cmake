 @par Directory contents
 
 - .cproject/.project: A pre-configured project file with the provided library
                       structure that produces an executable image with TASKING.

- TASKING                     : This folder contains
 
     - stm32f4xx.lsl          : This file is TASKING linker script that contains the 
                                STM32F4xx vector table and used to place program code (readonly) 
                                in internal FLASH and data (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in
                                internal SRAM. 
                                You can customize this file to your need.

     - cstart_thumb2.asm      : This file initializes the stack pointer and copy initialized
                                sections from ROM to RAM
                           
 @par How to use it ?

 - Open TASKING toolchain.
 - Click on File->Import, select General->'Existing Projects into Workspace' 
   and then click "Next". 
 - Browse to  TASKING workspace directory and select the project: 
   - STM324xG_EVAL: to configure the project for STM32F4xx devices.
 - Under Windows->Preferences->General->Workspace->Linked Resources, add 
   a variable path named "Cur_Path" which points to the folder containing
   "Libraries", "Project" and "Utilities" folders.
 - Rebuild all project files: Select the project in the "Project explorer" 
   window then click on Project->build project menu.
 - Run program: Select the project in the "Project explorer" window then click 
   Run->Debug (F11)

 @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
       preprocessor section: USE_STM324xG_EVAL, STM32F4XX, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER
