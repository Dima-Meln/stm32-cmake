@par Example Description 

  This example illustrates how to use the STM32F4xx new RTC's sub-seconds and
  Tamper feature (Filter, sampling) features. It simulates a precise chronometer
  with 10 record times possibilities stored in the Backup registers (10 registers
  for time (second, minutes and hours) and 10 registers for subsecond).
  
  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using
  STM324xG_EVAL’s LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use StopWatch with real 
  time display.

  After startup, a default 00:00:00:000 chronometer counter is displayed on the 
  LCD, it correspond to [Hours]:[minutes]:[seconds]:[milliseconds].
  User can manipulate the chronometer features using the Tamper, Key and Wakeup buttons:
    - press Wakeup button to start counter.
    - press Key button to save trials in the backup registers (max 10 actions).
    - press and hold Tamper button for 1 sec to reset all the backup registers.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM324xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board. 

  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Key push button.
    - Use Wakeup pash button. 
    - Use the TAMPER push button connected to PC.13 pin (EXTI Line13).

       
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
