@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the programmable BOR thresholds using the 
FLASH option bytes.

By maintaining the Key push-button pressed at Reset, the new BOR level will be 
programmed. To modify the BOR threshold, select the voltage range using the 
appropriate line "#define BOR_LEVEL OB_BOR_XXXX" in main.c file.
 
LED1 is toggling to indicate that the reset is released and the system is in RUN
mode otherwise the BOR is maintaining the reset.

@note The "system_stm32f4xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3988 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
 

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM324xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 led connected to PG.06 pin
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PG15 (EXTI Line15)
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
