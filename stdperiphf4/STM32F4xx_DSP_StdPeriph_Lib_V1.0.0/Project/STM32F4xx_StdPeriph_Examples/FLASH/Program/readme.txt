@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to program the STM32F4xx FLASH.

After Reset, the Flash memory Program/Erase Controller is locked. To unlock it,
the FLASH_Unlock function is used.
Before programming the desired addresses, an erase operation is performed using 
the flash erase sector feature. The erase procedure starts with the calculation of
the number of sector to be used. Then all these sectors will be erased one by one by
calling FLASH_EraseSector function. 

Once this operation is finished, the programming operation will be performed by 
using the FLASH_ProgramWord function. The written data is then checked and the
result of the programming operation is stored into the MemoryProgramStatus variable.
