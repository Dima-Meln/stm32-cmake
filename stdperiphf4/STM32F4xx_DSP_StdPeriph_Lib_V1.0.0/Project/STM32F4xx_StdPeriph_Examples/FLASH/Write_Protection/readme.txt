@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to enable and disable the write protection
for the STM32F4xx FLASH.

By maintaining the Key push-button pressed at Reset, the program will check the 
write protection status of FLASH_WRP_SECTORS (defined in main.c) 
  - If FLASH_WRP_SECTORS are write protected, the write protection will be disabled.
    Then LED1 will turn ON, if the protection disable operation is done correctly,
    otherwise LED3 turns ON.
  - If FLASH_WRP_SECTORS are not write protected, the write protection will be enabled.
    Then LED4 will turn ON, if the protection enable operation is done correctly,
    otherwise LED3 turns ON.

If after reset the Key push-button is not pressed, the program will simply turn ON LED2.

@note The "system_stm32f4xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3988 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>

      
@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM324xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board

  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PG15 (EXTI Line15)
