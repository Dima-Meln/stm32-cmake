@par Example Description 

This example describes a firmware Smartcard Interface based on the STM32F4xx USART
peripheral. The main purpose of this firmware example is to provide resources 
facilitating the development of an application using the USART peripheral in 
smartcard mode.

The firmware interface is composed of library source files developed in order to
support ISO7816-3/4 specification, an application example is also provided.

This example is based on the AN2598 "Smartcard interface with the STM32F101xx 
and STM32F103xx" application note. For more details, please refer to AN2598 
available on www.st.com

@note The "system_stm32f4xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3988 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM324xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins
    - Make sure that JP21 is closed.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the "smartcard.c" file to the project source list  
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
