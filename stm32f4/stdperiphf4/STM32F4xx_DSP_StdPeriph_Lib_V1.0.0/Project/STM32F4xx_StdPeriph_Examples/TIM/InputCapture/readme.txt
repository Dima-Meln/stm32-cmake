@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency of an 
external signal.

The TIMxCLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock /2 (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
TIM1 counter clock is SystemCoreClock (Hz)/2.

SystemCoreClock is set to 168 MHz.

TIM1 is configured in Input Capture Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM1 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency we use the TIM1 CC2 interrupt request,
so In the TIM1_CC_IRQHandler routine, the frequency of the external signal is computed. 
The "TIM1Freq" variable contains the external signal frequency:
TIM1Freq = TIM1 counter clock / Capture in Hz,
where the Capture is the difference between two consecutive TIM1 captures. 

The minimum frequency value to measure is 1100 Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM324xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM1 CH2 pin (PE.11).   
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
